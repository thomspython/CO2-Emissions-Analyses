## 🔍 Key Insights

### 🔥 Correlation Heatmap
- CO2 emissions strongly correlate with fuel consumption metrics.
- Engine size and cylinder count have a positive correlation with emissions.

### 🌿 Emissions Analysis
- **SUVs and Pickup Trucks** show the highest average CO2 emissions.
- **Compact cars and Two-Seaters** tend to be more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.
- **Hyundai Ioniq** and **Toyota Prius** are the most fuel-efficient models with the lowest emissions.

### ⛽ Fuel Type Impact
- **Z (Regular gasoline)** and **X (Premium gasoline)** tend to emit more CO2 than **E (Ethanol)** or **D (Diesel)**, though distribution varies.
- Hybrid and electric vehicles significantly reduce emissions.

### ⚙️ Transmission & Emissions
- Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and 7-speed automatic transmissions show lower average emissions compared to standard automatic or manual transmissions.

### 🚗 Make-Specific Insights
- Makes such as **Hyundai** and **Toyota** consistently lead in fuel efficiency and low emissions.
- **Mercedes-Benz** and **Dodge** models appear more frequently in the higher CO2 emission range.

### 📈 CO2 vs Engine Size
- There is a clear upward trend of emissions with larger engine sizes, especially in gasoline vehicles.
